      <h3>Simulating the interaction between spacecraft and radiation</h3>

      <section>
        <p>
          The Radiation And Trajectory Simulator (RATS) tool is a Python-based
          tool used to model the interaction between an antenna's propagating
          radiation pattern and an on-orbit satellite. RATS combines a database
          of three-dimensional models, trajectory information, and sensor data to
          predict when and if a specific satellite should able to detect radiation
          from a transmitting radio frequency (RF) source.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a high level, RATS is meant to complement other software tools
          developed by Slingshot Aerspace, including the Physically High-Fidelity
          Astrodynamics Simulation Engine (PHASE). the High-Accuracy EMI
          Remediation System (HAERTS), and Beacon.
        </p>
        <p>          
          For this reason, RATS shares many common elements with other software
          products developed at Slingshot Aerospace. For instance, RATS shares a
          common coordinate system (J2000) with PHASE, allowing the same trajectory
          data to be used on both platforms. Additionally, the heatmap format used
          by HAERTS is used within RATS to ensure the results from the latter can
          be easily integrated into the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a low level, RATS comprises three main sections. Simulation of the
          antenna's radiation is handled via the Numerical Electromagnetics Code
          (NEC) -- a well-known and highly-validated software used across the RF
          industry. Trajectories are read in using a JSON file exported from
          PHASE. Lastly, the satellite CAD models are externally developed
          using Blender; once sized to realistic dimensions, the resulting
          geometry is stored for future use and modification.

              Launched in 2024, the Uydu satellite was manufactured by the Turkish
              Aerospace Industries for roughly $600,000,000. The satellite's mission

              Construction-wise, the Uydu satellite comprises a main body and two
              solar panel arrays extending laterally to its side. For power consumption,
              the solar panels can be rotated to face the sun.
