      <h2>Why I choose WeasyPrint?</h2>

        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p>
          A couple of months ago, I got a project and was told to build PDF
          reports based on given JSON data sources. Briefly, the report contains
          text messages, charts and tables. Before this project, I had more than
          7 years back-end development background and 3 years web & mobile
          development background but still had no clue how to build beautiful
          reports in very limited time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. How to parse JSON sources and fetch required data?</li>
          <li>2. What tech stack to choose for the project?</li>
          <li>3. Should we build the report on client side or server side?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I don't want to make a rush decision even the deadline is quite
          urgent, I believed that the right tool will do the work fast and
          efficient. I spent a lot of time doing research on Google, Reddit,
          StackOverflow, GitHub. Finally found a couple potential tools like
          jsPDF, ReportLab and pyPDF. I have tried each of them in a week or two
          and built mockup report but I wasn't satisfied with the crude results.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first tool I decided to not use was jsPDF. The first reason was
          the charts would be blurry when rendering PDF, my question can be
          found on SO:
          <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53256587/canvas-charts-is-blurry-when-download-as-pdf"
            >Canvas charts is blurry when download as PDF </a
          >. Another reason was it was time consuming to parse the raw JSON
          source and it'd better to parse data and generate report on server
          side.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other reasons to give up other tools were either we couldn't afford,
          we will build more than two thusand reports per year and the price
          would be crazy if it was over the limit; the learning curve< is
          another cause, learn a new templating language or rules to build
          layout was challenging and takes too much time and our sales team
          can't wait that long.
        </p>
        <p>
          One month later after I did research and mockup, I was back to the
          beginning point. To be honest, I was a little bit frustrated because I
          still don't know what tool to use but the good side is I know what not
          to use for project under the circumstance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next week, I kept doing research and found
          <a href="https://pbpython.com/pdf-reports.html"
            >Creating PDF Reports with Pandas, Jinja and WeasyPrint</a
          >
          When I saw the samples from Weasyprint website, I was shocked and
          impressed by the gorges report. Weasyprint draw my attention and I
          started reading weasyprint docs and was happy that it uses HTML & CSS
          which I have enough knowledge. I can't wait to follow the samples to
          build a mockup in just half a day and showed it to my boss. I got a
          big WOW and I know we have found the right tool! Thank you Weasyprint!

          The second thing I check is the numbers of open issues and closed
          issues. You can see July, 2019 - August 2019 there were 28 issues had
          been closed, I believe this is a good sign and the project is
          reliable.

        You may observed that the chart looks really good and has very high
        quality but the captured image is a little bit blurry. This is another
        thing I want to share: we use Plotly Python generate svg files and
        insert them into our report and it is clear even we zoom out to 200%.
